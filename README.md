# Python-Logic-Challenges
Repository with Python solutions for logic programming challenges from the Dikastis platform. Each exercise explores a fundamental programming concept, such as conditionals, loops, lists, functions, recursion, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming. All solutions were implemented without using external libraries.

The goal is to practice and reinforce fundamental programming concepts by organizing the challenges by topic.

# Challenge Structure

Files are organized within a repository, according to the type of programming logic used:

- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Lists and list operations
- Functions and scope
- Recursion
- Dictionaries
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

# Technologies Used

- Python
- No external libraries were used

# Purpose

This repository is for educational purposes and serves as a portfolio to showcase my learning and practice. Itâ€™s also a useful resource for anyone looking to study or review logic programming using Python.
